GENERAL

* make script for extracting benchmarks for release
* better document the infrastructure

STATUS OF BENCHMARKS

To add: mvMuliply, suffixTree, editDistanceGraph
Perhaps add: graphColoring, nbody, separator, gaussianElimination, setCover, kMedian

breadthFirstSearch
  3 versions done (serial, non-deterministic, deterministic)
  Test code written

comparisonSort
  4 versions done (serial, stl-parallel, parallel quick, parallel sample)
  Test code written
 *Could possibly improve sampleSort for floating point (small data)

convexHull
  2 version (serial and quickhull)
 *Test code written (only covers upper hull)
 *Possibly add parabola test input

delaunayRefine
  1 version (incremental)
 *Test code needs to check triangle quality
 *add serial code
 *add nondeterministic code
 *more extensive correctness testing (some circumcenters out of region)

delaunayTriangulation
  2 versions (incremental, serial)
 *add nondeterministic code
 *more extensive testing (some circumcenters out of region)
 *fix test so it handles any boundary (unsing convex hull)

dictionary
  2 version (serial, deterministic)
  check code written
 *add nondeterministic
 *perhaps a determinacy bug, but not seen recently

integerSort
  2 versions (serial, parallel)
  check written

lassoRegression
 *needs work

maximalIndependentSet
  3 versions (serial, nondeterministic, deterministic)
  check written

maximalMatching
  3 versions (serial, nondeterministic, deterministic)
  check written
 *could be optimized

minSpanningTree
  2 versions (serial, deterministic)
  check written
 *add non deterministic
 *could be optimized

nearestNeighbor
 *need to merge aapo's code into nearestNeighbors

nearestNeighbors
  1 version, but with two implementations of oct tree
  check written, but only tests a small sample
 *need more measurements on fast oct tree
 *need serial version

rayCast
  1 version
 *add serial code (could be specialized version of parallel)
  test written, but only tests small sample
 *make tests more robust

removeDuplicates
  2 version (serial, deterministic)
  check code written
 *add nondeterministic

spanningTree
  2 versions (serial, deterministic)
  check written
 *add non deterministic
 *could be optimized

suffixArray
  3 versions (serial KS, parallel KS, and other parallel)
  check written
 *replace radix sort in serial KS with something reasonable
